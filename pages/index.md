title: "Rackt - where the magic happens"
---

Rackt is an organization founded by [Ryan Florence](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence) and
[Michael Jackson](https://twitter.com/mjackson). They've started it to work together
on the first version of React Router. Since then the organization grew both
in the number of [repos](https://github.com/rackt) and a number of
[team members](https://github.com/orgs/rackt/people).

All of us have a great passion to build cool projects which can benefit others.
